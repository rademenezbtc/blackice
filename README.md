# BlackIce

**Distributed FROST Silent Payments.** BlackIce lets a hardware multisig pay a silent-payment
address, with every step coordinated over an end-to-end encrypted Marmot group and
no server in the middle.

Built at bitcoin++ Seoul 2026 for *Best Use of the Marmot Protocol*.

Security scope and remaining mainnet blockers: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Simple local app (Signet)

Keep Frostsnap for creating/restoring the wallet. Complete the one-time bridge
import and signer pairing documented below; existing A/B configurations work.
After setup, close Frostsnap and double-click `scripts/BlackIce.command` on each
Mac. Enter that Mac's configured signer name (A or B). The launcher starts the
bridge and coordinator and opens BlackIce with a private per-launch link in the default browser. Bare
localhost links cannot access wallet state or issue commands. If access expires,
reopen with the latest launcher/terminal link. Press Ctrl+C
in its Terminal window to stop it. Bun and the built bridge are prerequisites;
this is a local web app with a Mac launcher, not a signed native app installer.

The coordinator adds recipients and sats, selects wallet coins, and clicks
**Review payment**. BlackIce fetches the funding transactions from Blockstream's
Signet explorer, checks confirmation/unspent status and transaction IDs, and
calculates change. **Ask signers to approve** starts the ceremony after rechecking
the coins. Both signers follow the on-screen prompts and approve on their devices.
After the first round, choose **Continue to device signing**. Finally, explicitly
broadcast to Signet or export the signed transaction.

No JSON proposal file is needed in this flow. Manual coin selection still needs
the funding txid, output number, receive/change branch and address index. The
bridge validates wallet ownership before device approval. Automatic wallet
scanning, fee-rate estimation, QR pairing and CSV import are not implemented.
Fees are entered as a total in sats; adjust them for larger batches. Explorer
checks disclose selected outpoints to that service, not recipient SP addresses
or private keys. Private signing shares remain on the devices.

Relay events are under **Advanced details**; click the log footer for diagnostics.
The CLI and file proposals remain available for troubleshooting.

## The problem

Multisig is the safest way to hold bitcoin, but it gives up privacy at every step:

- **It can't pay silent payments.** Sending to a silent-payment address (BIP 352)
  needs the combined private key of every input. A multisig split across devices
  never has that in one place, so until now only single-key wallets could pay one.
- **Coordination leaks.** Co-signers pass transactions over Signal, email or a
  coordinator server, which learn phone numbers, amounts, recipients and timing.
- **The chain sees the multisig.** Script multisig reveals its policy every time it spends.

## What BlackIce does

| Layer | How | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Recipient** | Silent payments, with each device contributing its own ECDH share and a BIP 374 DLEQ proof ([Frostsnap PR #640](https://github.com/frostsnap/frostsnap/pull/640)) | A hardware multisig can pay a static `sp1…` address; each payment lands in a fresh output nobody can link to it |
| **Signing** | FROST threshold keys on [Frostsnap](https://frostsnap.com) devices | Any k-of-n devices produce one Schnorr signature: on-chain it's an ordinary single-key taproot spend |
| **Coordination** | [Marmot](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/marmot): MLS group messaging over Nostr | Every ceremony message is end-to-end encrypted; relays only store ciphertext; no phone numbers, no server |

## How a payment gets signed

```
Frostsnap A ─USB─ bridge A ─ BlackIce A ─┐                     ┌─ BlackIce B ─ bridge B ─USB─ Frostsnap B
                                         └─ encrypted Marmot ──┘
                                            group on public
                                            Nostr relays
```

1. **Propose.** The coordinator's bridge builds the transaction. The silent-payment output can't be computed yet.
2. **ECDH.** Each device asks its owner ("Hold to Contribute") and returns its ECDH share with a DLEQ proof that it used its real key share.
3. **Derive.** Each signer's bridge verifies every proof and derives the payment output. Each signer publishes a hash of the transaction it derived; nobody continues unless they all match.
4. **Sign.** Each device shows the silent-payment address, amount and fee itself; its owner approves ("Hold to Sign") and it returns a FROST signature share.
5. **Combine.** The shares become one Schnorr signature, ready to broadcast.

Private keys never leave the devices, wallet databases and bridge state never leave
each laptop, and the laptop is never trusted with what is being paid: the device shows it.

## Demo: it works on Signet

Two Frostsnap devices (2-of-2) on two MacBooks, coordinated only through a Marmot
group on `relay.damus.io`, `nos.lol` and `relay.primal.net`:

- **Paid 1,000 sat to a `tsp1…` silent-payment address.** Transaction
  [`dec10c6d…898d`](https://mempool.space/signet/tx/dec10c6da4742ec13f2419c3f1abcb0ee2d2a6c3a378128929ade0549544898d)
  confirmed in Signet block 329,605.
- **On-chain it's a plain taproot spend:** one key-path input, two taproot outputs.
  The payment landed at `tb1pvw3u…v3dsr`, which nobody can link to the `tsp1…` address.
- **The relays learned nothing:** 12 Nostr events and 19 KB seen by signer B, none
  containing the recipient address, the ceremony messages or the wallet IDs.
- **Walkthrough:** [docs/ceremony.mp4](docs/ceremony.mp4) steps through the dashboard
  from proposal to confirmation.

## Status and limits

- **Signet only.** Development firmware from Frostsnap PR #640, which is not yet
  reviewed; the bridge is pinned to core revision `538b0ec`.
- An intermittent device serial-decoding crash was seen once during testing and is
  not yet fixed upstream.
- Not audited. Do not use with real funds.

## Run it yourself

Each Mac runs **one** `blackice` process (`bun run vault`). It launches that Mac's own
`frostsnap_sp_bridge` (own state dir, pinned SP firmware digest) and carries
the bridge's opaque payloads through the encrypted Marmot group. Wallet
databases and bridge state never leave the Mac. Protocol: `frostsnap-sp-bridge/1`.

```
A (coordinator + share 1)            B (share 2)
prepare ──► fs.proposal ───────────► ecdh (device approval) ─► offer
ecdh ─► offer ─► fs.offer ◄───────── fs.offer
   ── 2/2 offers: MILESTONE-1 GATE (type `sign`) ──
fs.sign_request (same offers) ─────► sign (verify proofs, derive SP output, device approval)
sign ─► shares ─► fs.shares ◄─────── shares
combine ─► signed tx (not broadcast) ─► fs.complete
```

### 1. Install (each Mac)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rademenezbtc/blackice.git && cd blackice
bun install && bun test
```

### 2. Initialise (each Mac; Frostsnap app closed, device plugged in)

```bash
# Signer B
bun run vault init --name B --device <B_DEVICE_ID> \
  --bridge ~/Downloads/Frostsnap-SP-Bridge-mac-arm64/frostsnap_sp_bridge \
  --state ~/frostsnap-sp-bridge-state

# Signer A (coordinator)
bun run vault init --name A --role coordinator --device <A_DEVICE_ID> \
  --bridge <path>/frostsnap_sp_bridge --state ~/frostsnap-sp-bridge-state
```

`init` creates a Marmot identity in `~/.marmot-vault/<name>/`, asks the bridge
(offline) for the Signet wallet, pins key id + access structure, finds this
Mac's share index from `--device`, and prints the **npub** to share.

### 3. Pair (exchange npubs out of band)

```bash
# on A
bun run vault member --name A <B_NPUB> 2
# on B
bun run vault member --name B <A_NPUB> 1
bun run vault coordinator --name B <A_NPUB>
```

### 4. Run (B first, then A)

```bash
bun run vault run --name B      # waits for A's invite (accepts only A)
bun run vault run --name A      # creates the group and invites B
```

### Live dashboard

`vault run` serves a dashboard at **http://127.0.0.1:8787** (`--port N` to change,
`--no-dashboard` to disable; it listens on localhost only). It shows the payment,
the ceremony steps, both devices' progress, the "both devices derived the identical
transaction" check, the signed txid with **Broadcast to Signet** / mempool.space,
and a live **"What the relays see"** feed of every Nostr event this Mac sent or
received, with a counter that flags any plaintext (recipient address, ceremony JSON,
wallet ids) found in it. On the coordinator it also has Propose / Request signatures /
Cancel buttons. No external fonts or scripts, so it works on venue Wi-Fi.

Rehearse it without hardware (`MOCK_APPROVE_MS` simulates the time to press the device):
```bash
bun run relay 7777
MOCK_DEVICE=devB MOCK_SHARE=2 MOCK_APPROVE_MS=6000 bun run vault run --name B --port 8788
MOCK_DEVICE=devA MOCK_APPROVE_MS=2500 bun run vault run --name A
```
(with mock-bridge configs from `vault init --bridge scripts/mock-bridge.sh … --home /tmp/rehearsal`).

### 5. Milestone 1 (on A)

```bash
propose proposal.json           # proposal.json: see below
# both devices: approve ECDH  → A prints "2 hardware-approved ECDH offers collected"
sign                            # only when ready to go further: devices verify + derive output, then approve
```

```json
{
  "inputs": [{ "txid": "<funding txid>", "vout": 0, "internal": false, "index": 0 }],
  "recipients": [{ "address": "tsp1…", "amount_sat": 1000 }],
  "change": { "index": 0, "amount_sat": 8700 }
}
```
The previous transaction is fetched from mempool.space/signet when only `txid` is
given. Inputs must be confirmed, default-account P2TR wallet UTXOs; `index` is the
address index. The signed transaction is printed, **not broadcast**.

REPL: `status`, `invite [npub]`, `propose <file>`, `sign`, `retry`, `cancel`, `quit`.

### Two inputs, two receivers (next hardware milestone)

The proposal accepts multiple inputs from the same Frostsnap wallet and an
ordered list of silent-payment recipients. Each input needs its actual previous
transaction (or txid for fetching), output number, and wallet derivation path.
Use `internal: true` for change UTXOs. Coin selection is manual.

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    { "txid": "<first funding txid>", "vout": 0, "internal": false, "index": 0 },
    { "txid": "<second funding txid>", "vout": 1, "internal": false, "index": 1 }
  ],
  "recipients": [
    { "address": "<first tsp1 address>", "amount_sat": 1000 },
    { "address": "<second tsp1 address>", "amount_sat": 2000 }
  ],
  "change": { "index": 1, "amount_sat": 6700 }
}
```

The illustrative amounts assume inputs totaling 10,000 sats and a 300-sat fee;
recalculate from the actual selected UTXOs. The dashboard displays every recipient
and amount, plus expandable input outpoints. Review all outputs on each device.
Inputs, recipients, amounts, and change are snapshotted when proposing: cancel and
start a new ceremony to change them. Do not change inputs after SP derivation.

After completion, **Export signed transaction** downloads the raw signed hex
without broadcasting. This provides the handoff artifact for a wallet such as
Sparrow; importing/reviewing/broadcasting it in Sparrow remains a manual acceptance
check, not a PSBT or Sparrow coordinator integration.

Automated coverage includes two input derivation paths and two distinct scan keys
in the Rust device/core simulation, repeated-address outputs in a separate test,
and the complete multi-recipient Marmot flow. The physical two-input/two-recipient
run and receiver detection are still pending. For acceptance, confirm both inputs
are unspent, prepare two independently scannable receivers, approve both devices,
verify the exported transaction, then check both receiver wallets after confirmation.

### Relays

Default: `relay.damus.io`, `nos.lol`, `relay.primal.net` (edit `relays` in
`~/.marmot-vault/<name>/config.json`). If public relays misbehave on venue Wi-Fi,
run one on A and point both configs at it (relay still sees only ciphertext):
```bash
bun run relay 7777              # on A → ws://<A's LAN IP>:7777 in both configs
```

### Rehearse without hardware

`scripts/mock-bridge.sh` mirrors the real bridge's wire shapes (events, statuses,
results from `frostsnap/sp_bridge/src/{main,lib}.rs`); set `MOCK_DEVICE`/`MOCK_SHARE`
and use it as `--bridge` with `bun run relay` to run A and B locally.
`test/app.test.ts` covers the flow, the milestone gate, sender binding, wallet
pinning, a swapped-offer attack, mismatched derivations and a device rejection.
`test/node.test.ts` guards against a marmot-ts 0.9 message-loss race (sends
overlapping ingests), which `VaultNode` avoids by queueing all MLS operations.

### What this app enforces (bridge README requirements)

- Marmot sender (MLS-authenticated; marmot-ts rejects rumor/sender mismatch) is bound to a configured share index.
- Wallet key id, access structure and protocol are pinned; proposals for anything else are refused.
- Invites accepted only from the configured coordinator; joining grants no signing authority.
- Fresh 32-byte session id per attempt, never reused; one open session per bridge; messages de-duplicated.
- Subset frozen at the first sign request; each signer checks every offer in it equals the one that signer actually sent.
- After `sign`, each signer publishes a hash of its bridge's `completed_task`; signature
  shares are released only when every signer derived the identical transaction.
- Proposals are refused if the local bridge's core revision differs from the pinned one,
  or if the device isn't connected with the expected SP firmware.
- Cancellation (`cancel`, device rejection, 20-min timeout) reaches every bridge.

## Reference implementation (TypeScript SP math)

```bash
bun install
bun test            # BIP352 + BIP374 official vectors, 2-of-2 ceremony checks
bun run demo        # coordinator + 2 devices over an in-memory relay
```

The demo uses software stand-ins for the devices. SP math is real; FROST
nonces and signature shares are opaque placeholders (`frost` fields), which
the Frostsnap bridge fills in.

### Reference ceremony (TypeScript path)

| # | Message | From | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `sp.ecdh_request` | coordinator | Sparrow PSBT, inputs, recipients (list), `inputHash`, `scanKeys` (≈ `RequestSpEcdh`) |
| 2 | `sp.offer` | device | per scan key: `x_j·B_scan` + full BIP374 DLEQ proof vs its share image, message = `input_hash`; opaque FROST offer (≈ `SpOffer`) |
| 3 | `sp.sign_request` | coordinator | subset, **proof bundle** (account polynomial, input hash, subset's shares), completed task with SP scripts (≈ `RoundConfirmed.sp` + `RequestSpSign`) |
| 4 | `sign.shares` | device | opaque FROST signature shares |
| 5 | `session.complete` / `session.abort` | either | txid / reason + culprit |

**Device checks** (mirrors #640):
- before an ECDH share: input hash and scan keys match its own derivation; inputs are vault keys.
- before signing: polynomial is its access structure; every proof verifies against the
  rebuilt share image; ≥ threshold distinct share indices per scan key; re-derived SP
  scripts equal the task's, else refuse; refuse SP outputs without proofs, or proofs for a plain send.

**Coordinator math** (`src/sp.ts`, `src/ceremony.ts`):
`x·B = Σ λ_j·share_j` → `C = (Σg_i)·x·B + (Σt_i)·B` over input tweak contexts
`a_i = g_i·x + t_i` → `S = input_hash·C` → `P_k = B_spend + hash(S‖k)·G`.
`k` follows transaction output order (Sparrow's), recipients sharing a scan key
count up together.
